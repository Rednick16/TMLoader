# TMLoader - iOS Loader

TMLoader is a tool that allows you to create mods for Terraria using Lua scripts. To create a mod, you need to have a main.lua file and any additional Lua files that you want to include in your mod.

## Building a Mod

1. Create a folder for your mod and place your main.lua file and any additional Lua files inside that folder.

2. Zip the folder containing your Lua files.

3. Open TMloader and navigate to the Mods Browser page.

4. Click the "+" button in the top left corner of the page.

5. Select your mod's zip file and click "Import".

6. Your mod will now be listed in the Mod Viewer page.

7. You can now interact with the installed mod :).

## Using the Lua Editor

TMLoader also includes a basic Lua editor that allows you to modify your mod's code at runtime and view log messages. To access the Lua editor:

1. Click on the "Editor" tab.

2. The Lua editor will open. You can now modify your mod's code and view log messages.

## Uploading Mods

TMLoader has a mod browser where users can browse and install mods. Currently, mods are added manually by the developer. However, a feature to allow creators to upload their mods and have them appear in the mod browser is being worked on.

Once the feature is completed, creators will be able to upload their mods through the Mod Broswe Page by Clicking the "+" and selecting upload. The mods will then be reviewed and, if approved, will appear in the mod browser for other users to browse and install. More information on how to upload mods will be provided once the feature is completed.

Stay tuned for updates on this feature and other upcoming changes to TMLoader.
